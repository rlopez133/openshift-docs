| Storage type | Description | Examples

|Block
a|* Presented to the operating system (OS) as a block device
* Suitable for applications that need full control of storage and operate at a low level on files
bypassing the file system
* Also referred to as a Storage Area Network (SAN)
* Non-shareable, which means that only one client at a time can mount an endpoint of this type

|File
a| * Presented to the OS as a file system export to be mounted
* Also referred to as Network Attached Storage (NAS)
* Concurrency, latency, file locking mechanisms, and other capabilities vary widely between protocols, implementations, vendors, and scales.

| Object
a| * Accessible through a REST API endpoint
* Configurable for use in the {product-title} Registry
* Applications must build their drivers into the application and/or container.

|===

You can use {gluster-native} GlusterFS (a hyperconverged or cluster-hosted
storage solution) or {gluster-external} GlusterFS (an externally hosted storage
solution) for block, file, and object storage for {product-title} registry,
logging, and metrics.
