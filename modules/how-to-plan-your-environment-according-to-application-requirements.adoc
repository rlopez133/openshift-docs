= How to plan your environment according to application requirements

Consider an example application environment:

[options="header",cols="5"]
|===
|Pod Type |Pod Quantity |Max Memory |CPU Cores |Persistent Storage

|apache
|100
|500MB
|0.5
|1GB

|node.js
|200
|1GB
|1
|1GB

|postgresql
|100
|1GB
|2
|10GB

|JBoss EAP
|100
|1GB
|1
|1GB
|===

Extrapolated requirements: 550 CPU cores, 450GB RAM, and 1.4TB storage.

Instance size for nodes can be modulated up or down, depending on your
preference. Nodes are often resource overcommitted. In this deployment
scenario, you can choose to run additional smaller nodes or fewer larger nodes
to provide the same amount of resources. Factors such as operational agility and
cost-per-instance should be considered.

Some applications lend themselves well to overcommitted environments, and some
do not. Most Java applications and applications that use huge pages are examples
of applications that would not allow for overcommitment. That memory can not be
used for other applications. In the example above, the environment would be
roughly 30 percent overcommitted, a common ratio.
