= About the node tuning Operator

The node tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the
tuned daemon.

The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel
tuning. The node tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to
users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified
by user needs.
