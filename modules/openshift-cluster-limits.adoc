| Number of pods per namespace footnoteref:[objectpernamespace,There are
a number of control loops in the system that need to iterate over all objects
in a given namespace as a reaction to some changes in state. Having a large
number of objects of a given type in a single namespace can make those loops
expensive and slow down processing given state changes.]
