Consider the following object limits when you plan your {product-title} cluster.

These limits are based on on the the largest possible cluster. For smaller
clusters, the limits are proportionally lower. There are many factors that
influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data
format.

In most cases, exceeding these limits results in lower overall performance. It
does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail.
